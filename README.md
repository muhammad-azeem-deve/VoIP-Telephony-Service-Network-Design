# VoIP Telephony Service Network Design
Cisco Packet Tracer Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a Voice over IP (VoIP) telephony network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network supports voice communication between IP phones using Cisco routers and switches.

## Objectives
- Design a VoIP-enabled network
- Configure IP phones
- Implement Call Manager Express (CME)
- Enable voice VLAN and DHCP
- Ensure end-to-end voice connectivity

## Network Components
- Cisco Router (CME enabled)
- Cisco Switch
- IP Phones
- PCs for testing
- Voice and Data VLANs

## Technologies Used
- VoIP
- DHCP
- VLAN
- CME (Call Manager Express)
- Cisco IOS

## How to Run
1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Load the `.pkt` file
3. Power on all devices
4. Verify IP phone registration
5. Make test calls between IP phones

## Expected Outcome
Successful voice communication between IP phones with proper call setup and clear audio transmission.
